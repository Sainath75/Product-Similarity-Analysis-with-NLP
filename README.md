# Product Similarity Analysis with NLP

This project explores product similarity analysis using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages TF-IDF and Word2Vec algorithms to analyze textual descriptions and recommend similar products.

## Key Features

- **Statistical NLP Approach:** Utilizes TF-IDF for feature extraction and cosine similarity for product comparisons.
- **Paragraph Vectorization with Word2Vec:** Employs Word2Vec to enhance understanding of textual data and improve similarity analysis.
- **Flexible Recommendation System:** Provides functions for retrieving and displaying similar products based on input.
- **Scalable and Extendable:** Implemented in Python, using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Gensim libraries, ensuring scalability and ease of extension.
